âœ¨# Architecture:


# Building a complete solution involves a series of steps.  Using the MERN stack with Express.js, React.js, Node.js, and MongoDB. Please note that this example is meant for educational purposes, and in a production environment, you would need to address additional concerns such as security, error handling, and scalability.


# Backend (Node.js, Express, MongoDB):

Use Express.js to create a RESTful API.
MongoDB to store the mappings between the hashed URLs and the original URLs.
# Frontend (React.js):

Build a simple UI for interacting with the URL shortening and redirection functionality.
# Hashing Algorithm:

Use a secure hashing algorithm (e.g., SHA-256) to generate unique hashes for the URLs.
# Security Considerations:

Implement input validation and sanitize user inputs to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.
Use HTTPS to secure data transmission.
Secure MongoDB connections and enforce access control.
# Testing:

Write unit tests for the backend API using testing libraries like Mocha or Jest.
Conduct end-to-end tests for the frontend using testing frameworks like Jest and React Testing Library.

---
# Documentation:

Create a comprehensive README.md explaining the MERN stack architecture, how to set up and deploy the application.
Include a setup.md with step-by-step instructions for deploying and using the application.
Add a todo.md for any unfinished tasks and assumptions.md to document any assumptions made during development.
# Code Quality:

Organize your code logically, follow best practices, and implement error handling.
Keep backend and frontend code separate for maintainability.
# Scalability:

MongoDB can be scaled horizontally by adding more nodes to the cluster.
Use load balancing for the Express.js backend to handle increased traffic.
# Automation:

Implement a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment using tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions.
# Swagger:

Integrate Swagger documentation for the API to assist other developers in understanding and interacting with your API.
# Acknowledgments:

Acknowledge any open-source libraries or tools used in your project.

# Git:

Keep your Git commits organized and use meaningful commit messages.
This MERN stack-based solution provides a full-stack application with a React.js frontend for user interaction and a Node.js backend with Express for handling URL shortening and redirection. Ensure to follow best practices for each component of the stack to create a clean, scalable, and maintainable solution.

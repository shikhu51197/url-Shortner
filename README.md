✨ # Architecture:
---
This URL Hashing System provides a comprehensive solution to KGS's marketing department's challenges with long URLs and UTM tracking. The system ensures appropriate authentication, association, and tracking of hashed URLs. It is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) for a robust and scalable architecture.Building a complete solution involves a series of steps.  Please note that this example is meant for educational purposes, and in a production environment, you would need to address additional concerns such as security, error handling, and scalability.

# Architecture Choice

The choice of the MERN stack was driven by the need for a flexible, scalable, and easy-to-integrate solution. Here's a brief overview:

$  MongoDB: Chosen as the database for its NoSQL nature, allowing flexibility in handling various data structures and scalability options.

$ Express.js: Used to create a RESTful API for seamless communication between the frontend and backend components.

$ React.js: Employed for building the front end to provide a dynamic and responsive user interface.

$ Node.js: Serves as the runtime environment for the entire application, ensuring consistent execution.

# Authentication, Association, and Tracking
The system employs user authentication to ensure secure interactions. Hashed URLs are associated with their original counterparts, and click events are tracked for analytics, providing valuable insights for marketing strategies.


## Getting Started 
    
# Functionality

  ⭕ URL Shortening
  
       Users can input long URLs, and the system generates a unique, shortened URL using a secure hashing algorithm (e.g., SHA-256).

 ⭕ URL Redirection

    Shortened URLs, when accessed, redirect users to their original, long URLs.

 ⭕ Copy to Clipboard

    Users can easily copy the shortened URL to the clipboard for quick sharing.

 ⭕ Error Handling
     
     The application incorporates robust error handling to ensure a smooth user experience:

    ✨Invalid URL: Users are notified when attempting to shorten an empty or invalid URL.

    ✨Shortened URL Copy: Users are informed if there is no URL to copy.

    ✨URL Shortening Failure: If an error occurs during the URL shortening process, users receive an error message.

    ✨Clipboard Copy Failure: If copying to the clipboard fails, users are notified of the error.

⭕ Form Validation 

      Explain the rules and requirements for form validation in your application.

⭕ Error Messages for Authentication

    Provide a list of possible form validation errors and their corresponding error messages.

⭕ Invalid Email Format:

     Message: "Please enter a valid email address."
     
⭕ Invalid Password:

     Message: "Password must be at least 8 characters long and include at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, and one digit."
⭕ Invalid Phone Format:

    Message: "Please enter a valid 10-digit phone number."
⭕ User Already Exists:

    Message: "An account with this email address already exists. Please use a different email."
⭕ Server Error:

    Message: "Something went wrong on our end. Please try again later."


💫Backend (Node.js)

        The backend is a Node.js server using Express, MongoDB for data storage, bcrypt for password hashing, and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication.
        The URL shortening logic involves hashing the original URL using the object-hash library.Enter the original URL in the provided input field.
     Click the "Shorten URL" button to generate a shortened URL.
    Copy the shortened URL and share it as needed.
    Users accessing the shortened URL will be redirected to the original long URL.

Endpoints:

       /signup: User signup with validation.
      /login: User login with JWT token generation.
      /:- The URL shortening logic involves hashing the original URL using the object-hash library.
      
💫Frontend (React.js)

    The front end is a React.js application with simple components for signup and login, UrlShortner.

Components:

           Signup.js: User signup form.
          Login.js: User login form.
          UrlShotner:- Url Modal part
         
✨Hosting on Vercel

     Build the React app:
     cd frontend
    npm run build
    Install Vercel CLI:
    npm install -g vercel
    
Deploy to Vercel:

     cd frontend
     vercel
    
    Follow the prompts to deploy your application.

# Tests
---
$ Backend API:
  Write unit tests using testing libraries like Mocha Jest , and Postman.

$ Frontend (if applicable):
  Write unit tests using Jest and React Testing Library.
  
$ API documentation:
 Integrate Swagger for clear and interactive API documentation.

# Backend (Node.js, Express, MongoDB):

Use Express.js to create a RESTful API.
MongoDB to store the mappings between the hashed URLs and the original URLs.

# Frontend (React.js):

Build a simple UI for interacting with the URL shortening and redirection functionality.

# Hashing Algorithm:

Use a secure hashing algorithm (e.g., SHA-256) to generate unique hashes for the URLs.

# Security Considerations:

Implement input validation and sanitize user inputs to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.
Use HTTPS to secure data transmission.
Secure MongoDB connections and enforce access control.

# Testing:

Write unit tests for the backend API using testing libraries like Mocha or Jest.
Conduct end-to-end tests for the front end using testing frameworks like Jest and React Testing Library.
